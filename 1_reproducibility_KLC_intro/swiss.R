################# Goals ######################
# 1. Plot two variables simultaneously
# 2. Visualize the effects of multiple variables 
#    simultaneously

# We will use some built-in data today.

#This is data on swiss fertality rates in the late 1800s.  
data(swiss)

#recode the Catholic percentage variable to indicate 
# majority Catholic provinces
swiss$Catholic <- ifelse(swiss$Catholic > 50, 1, 0)

# Note that we will later assume that provinces that are not
# majority Catholic are majority Protestant

#look at the data by clicking on the dataset name in your 
# Workspace/Environment or by using the following command:
swiss

# We want to understand why some provinces had lower fertility 
# rates.We have several variables that can explain this: 
colnames(swiss)

# A simple linear regression looks at the effect of Agriculture
# on fertility
mod1<-lm(Fertility~Agriculture, data=swiss)
summary(mod1)

# Multiple Regression is simply an extension of linear
# regression instead of y = a + b*x we now have 
# y = a + b1*x + b2*x. We refer to the things we 
# estimate (a, b1, and b2) as coefficients. We can 
# interpret these coefficients exactly like we did 
# before.  Multiple regression allows us to test 
# multiple statistical relationships at once. 

# Lets continue with the swiss example.  How can we test 
# if Agriculture and Catholicism matter simultaneously? 
mod2 <- lm( Fertility ~ Agriculture + Catholic, swiss)
summary(mod2)

# create a pdf file
